        <summary><strong>🧠 1. The Knowing World</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Pythagoras&rsquo; Theorem can be extended to three dimensions by applying it in two perpendicular triangles &mdash; often involving paths through cuboids or pyramids.</p>
        <p>In 3D, we often use the formula:</p>
        <p><code>d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}</code> &mdash; where <code>d</code> is the space diagonal in a cuboid, and <code>x, y, z</code> are its side lengths.</p>
        <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What is different about a diagonal that passes through space compared to a diagonal on a flat surface?</p>

        <summary><strong>🧬 2. The Human Story</strong></summary>
        <p>Architects and engineers often use 3D thinking to calculate true lengths for rafters, steel beams, or flight paths. This skill helps design safely and accurately in a three-dimensional world.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> What professions rely on being able to calculate unseen distances in space? What tools do they use?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Sketch a cube or cuboid and draw in a 3D diagonal from one corner to the opposite.</li>
            <li>Write a short description or story imagining yourself travelling along the diagonal path &mdash; what do you notice?</li>
            <li>Try to explain the logic of the 3D Pythagoras formula in your own words or as a comic strip.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Build a cuboid and mark the space diagonal.</li>
            <li>Use two applications of Pythagoras to calculate the diagonal step-by-step.</li>
            <li>Try designing a box, ramp, or tunnel where calculating this diagonal is essential.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Optional Tech Add-on:</strong> Create a simple 3D visual using a sketchpad tool or Tinkercad. Upload a screenshot of your labelled diagram.</p>

        <summary><strong>🌀 5. The Living Body</strong></summary>
        <p><em>Pause:</em> Breathe in and imagine moving along the diagonal line of a cuboid. Stretch in all three directions: up, forward, and sideways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reach one hand to the sky, one to the front, one to the side &mdash; then gently bring them to centre.</li>
            <li>Close your eyes for 10 seconds and picture a diagonal travelling through a room.</li>
        </ul>
