        <summary><strong>🧠 1. The Knowing World</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Trigonometric ratios are not just for acute angles &mdash; they extend to all angles up to 360&deg; using the unit circle. The x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle is cos &theta;, the y-coordinate is sin &theta;, and tan &theta; = sin &theta; / cos &theta;.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Angles between 0&deg; and 90&deg;: acute, all ratios positive.</li>
            <li>Angles between 90&deg; and 180&deg;: sine positive, cosine and tangent negative.</li>
            <li>Angles between 180&deg; and 270&deg;: tangent positive, sine and cosine negative.</li>
            <li>Angles between 270&deg; and 360&deg;: cosine positive, sine and tangent negative.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary><strong>🧬 2. The Human Story</strong></summary>
        <p>From navigation to architecture, angles greater than 90&deg; appear in design, navigation, and astronomy. Ancient astronomers used trigonometry to track planets through all quadrants of the sky. Modern engineers use it to design curves and slopes.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Where might you encounter an angle over 90&deg; in real life? Why might it be important to know its sine, cosine, or tangent?</p>

        <p>Ways to express your understanding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw a CAST diagram and colour-code which trig functions are positive in each quadrant.</li>
            <li>Create a mnemonic to remember the sign rules for each quadrant.</li>
            <li>Write a short story from the perspective of a point travelling around the unit circle.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Use the interactive sketch to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag the point around the unit circle and observe how sine, cosine, and tangent values change.</li>
            <li>Compare the coordinates of the point to the trig ratios.</li>
            <li>Find the related acute angle for obtuse and reflex angles.</li>
            <li>Check the signs of each ratio in all four quadrants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ethical Design Prompt:</strong> How could we design a trig tool that communicates ratio sign changes without relying on visual colour cues?</p>

        <p><em>Move like the unit circle:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stand tall facing forward (0&deg;), then slowly rotate your body through 360&deg;.</li>
            <li>Notice how your perspective changes as you pass 90&deg;, 180&deg;, 270&deg;, and return to 0&deg;.</li>
            <li>Stretch your arms out as radii to feel quadrant positions physically.</li>
        </ul>
