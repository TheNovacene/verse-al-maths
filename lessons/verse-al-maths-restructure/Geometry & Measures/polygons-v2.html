    <summary><strong>🌍 The Knowing World</strong></summary>
    <p>Use the interactive tool to draw diagonals from a single vertex and divide each polygon into triangles. Record how many triangles you can form, and use that to calculate the total sum of interior angles for polygons with 3 to 8 sides. What pattern do you notice?</p>
