        <summary>🌍 <strong>The Knowing World</strong></summary>
        <p>Learn how bearings are measured clockwise from the North direction and expressed in three digits, such as 045&deg; or 270&deg;. Bearings are commonly used in navigation, surveying, and direction-finding.</p>

        <summary>😜 <strong>Final Task</strong></summary>
        <p>Click &ldquo;Set Target&rdquo; in the app above. Rotate the arrow to match the target bearing. Record at least 3 successful matches and describe any strategies you used. Why is a small margin of error (e.g., &plusmn;5&deg;) acceptable in some real-world applications?</p>
