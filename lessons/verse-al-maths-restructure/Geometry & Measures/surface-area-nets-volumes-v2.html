    <summary style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>The Knowing World</strong></summary>
    <p>What is the relationship between a 3D shape and its 2D net? How do nets help us understand surface area, and how does shape construction relate to volume? This lesson helps you explore these ideas using an interactive builder tool.</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>The Human Story</strong></summary>
    <p>From ancient pyramids to modern packaging, humans have long used geometry to design and build. Nets and surface area calculations were essential in engineering, art, and architecture. How might you use these skills today?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>The Expressive Self</strong></summary>
    <p>Use the net-building tool creatively. Build your own solids and reflect: how do the different nets feel as you fold them into shapes? Which were easiest or most challenging? How does seeing the surface area visually help you understand it better?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>The Designed World</strong></summary>
    <p>This application helps you experiment with nets and shapes. Try building a cube, then a triangular prism. Compare surface areas and volumes. What patterns emerge? How might this tool help a designer or engineer in the real world?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>The Living Body</strong></summary>
    <p>How do your hands and eyes help you visualise the net folding? What does it feel like to build and manipulate 3D forms digitally? Take a moment to sketch or trace your mental image of the shapes you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
</details>
<details style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
    <summary style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Final Task</strong></summary>
    <p>Use the interactive tool to build at least three different solids. For each, record the number of faces, the total surface area, and the volume. Can you find a consistent way to calculate each? Explain your method in your own words.</p>
