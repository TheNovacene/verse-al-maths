    <div style="padding: 10px;">Area is a measure of the amount of space inside a 2D shape. When shapes are combined into compound figures, calculating the total area involves breaking them into simpler parts. This lesson helps you make sense of complex shapes by understanding how to calculate areas through dissection and summation.</div>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">The Human Story 👥</summary>
    From architectural blueprints to urban planning, calculating areas accurately is a skill used by engineers, designers, landscapers, and even artists. Being able to assess the size of a space is not only practical&mdash;it&rsquo;s empowering. Where might *you* use area calculations in your life?

    <summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">The Expressive Self 🧠</summary>
    Try exploring the shapes creatively: how many different ways can you break them up? Which shapes feel familiar to you? Can you find more than one way to get the same area? Mathematics is not just logical&mdash;it&rsquo;s playful.

    Use the interactive tool above to:
    <ul>
        <li>Drag and arrange simple geometric shapes to create a compound figure.</li>
        <li>Manually calculate the total area based on the visible dimensions.</li>
        <li>Enter your area estimate into the answer box and click &ldquo;Check Answer&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Observe feedback to guide your understanding.</li>
    </ul>
    Pay attention to how shapes fit together&mdash;and how accurate calculations can depend on clear reasoning and careful measurement.

    <summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">The Living Body 🧍</summary>
    Try sketching the shapes you see with pen and paper. Trace your finger along their edges. Mentally walk through how the shapes build up or break apart. Movement and sensation can strengthen your understanding and memory.

    <summary style="font-size: 1.3em;">Final Task ✅</summary>
    Create your own compound shape using the tool. Break it into smaller shapes and record their individual areas. Add them to find the total. Then, challenge a peer to estimate the area of your creation and verify each other&rsquo;s results. What strategies did you both use? Were they the same?
