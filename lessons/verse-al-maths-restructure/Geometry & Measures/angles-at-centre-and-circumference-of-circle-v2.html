<h2><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">🔵 Exploring the Angle at the Centre and Circumference</span></h2>
<p>Use the interactive tool below to explore how the angle at the centre of a circle relates to the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc. What do you notice as you move the points around?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>In a circle, the angle at the centre is always <strong>twice</strong> the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc.</li>
        <li>This is true regardless of the size of the circle or the location of the points, as long as they lie on the same arc.</li>
        <li>This fundamental geometric rule is useful in many problems involving circles and angles.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>This elegant relationship was known to ancient Greek mathematicians like Euclid, who included it in his famous *Elements*.</li>
        <li>It reflects early human attempts to understand circular motion, astronomy, and navigation using geometry.</li>

        <li>How do the dynamic visuals in the interactive help you "feel" or intuitively understand the relationship?</li>
        <li>Does seeing this symmetry give you a sense of satisfaction or harmony? Why?</li>
        <li>Try sketching your own diagrams showing this relationship and decorating them creatively.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>This property is used in engineering and design wherever circular arcs are involved &ndash; from clock faces to wheel spokes to circular gears.</li>
        <li>Designers rely on predictable angle relationships to create balanced and functional circular patterns.</li>
        <li>Can you spot examples of this principle in architecture or product design around you?</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Your eyes perceive angles and arcs constantly &mdash; from the circular iris to radial symmetry in nature (e.g. flowers, shells).</li>
        <li>Brain and eye coordination helps you track curved motion &mdash; such as catching a ball or watching a planet move across the sky.</li>
        <li>Notice how your hand naturally traces arcs when drawing circles &mdash; this is your body using geometric intuition!</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Explain, in your own words, why the angle at the centre is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc.</li>
        <li>Design and annotate your own example diagram showing this relationship clearly.</li>
        <li>Extension: Can you prove this property using isosceles triangles or circle theorems?</li>
    </ul>
