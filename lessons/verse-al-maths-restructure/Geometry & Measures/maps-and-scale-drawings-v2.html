<details>
    <summary>THE KNOWING WORLD</summary>
    <p>Explore how scales represent real-world distances on a map. Use the interactive tool to simulate measurements and translate them into real-world equivalents. Engage with ratios, proportions, and conversion factors.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>THE HUMAN STORY</summary>
    <p>How have cartographers, engineers, and explorers used scale drawings to navigate and design? Why is accuracy crucial in creating scaled representations of our environment? Reflect on historical and modern-day significance.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>THE EXPRESSIVE SELF</summary>
    <p>What personal connections do you have with maps or journeys? Use your creativity to design a scaled map of a place meaningful to you. Think about clarity, labeling, and visual appeal.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>THE DESIGNED WORLD</summary>
    <p>Use the interactive tool to solve challenges involving converting between real and map distances. Calculate unknowns, apply scale factors, and receive instant feedback. What strategies helped you make accurate conversions?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>THE LIVING BODY</summary>
    <p>Pay attention to how your spatial awareness and hand-eye coordination help you visualize and construct scale drawings. Do physical gestures (like measuring with fingers or pointing) aid your understanding?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>FINAL TASK</summary>
    <p>Design a detailed scaled map of a fictional town or environment. Include a clear scale, labeled landmarks, and at least three tasks where the viewer must calculate either real-world or map distances based on your scale.</p>
