<h2>📘 Exploring Distance-Time Graphs</h2>
<p>Use this interactive app to construct and analyze a journey. Plot the motion on a distance-time graph, then answer related questions to deepen your understanding of speed, intervals, and total distance traveled.</p>

    <summary><strong>🌍 The Knowing World</strong></summary>
    <p>Use the distance-time graph to interpret speed and changes in motion. What does the slope of each segment represent?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><strong>🧭 The Human Story</strong></summary>
    <p>Imagine this journey is a daily routine. What real-world contexts could this graph represent? Who might experience such a movement?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><strong>🎨 The Expressive Self</strong></summary>
    <p>Create a story to match your graph. Use movement and time creatively to reflect emotional or dramatic events.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><strong>🛠️ The Designed World</strong></summary>
    <p>Distance-time graphs are used in engineering and design to analyze motion, travel efficiency, and system dynamics. How might this apply to transport or robotics?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><strong>🧍 The Living Body</strong></summary>
    <p>How do different rates of motion (like walking, running, or pausing) appear on the graph? What do these intervals say about energy and effort?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><strong>✅ Final Task</strong></summary>
    <p>Design your own journey on the graph. Add stops, changes in speed, and explain what your graph tells us about the trip. Present it to a peer or submit it as a reflection.</p>
