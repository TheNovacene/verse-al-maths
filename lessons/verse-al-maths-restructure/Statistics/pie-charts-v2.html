    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🧠 The Knowing World</summary>
    <p><strong>Focus Concept (KS4 Statistics):</strong> Using pie charts to represent categorical data as fractions, percentages and angles, especially in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) contexts.</p>
    <p><strong>Seeds of Change (KS4):</strong> Interpret and construct pie charts; use fractions, percentages and proportional reasoning to describe and compare sectors.</p>
    <h3>Activity 1 &ndash; Pie Chart Builder (SDG Data &amp; Angles)</h3>
    <p>Use this app to practise turning SDG-themed category data into fractions, percentages and angles, and then into a pie chart.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 100.0000%; padding-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_aqCoBYk/uLNHjvytk_Qx_AbH_obcvg/view?embed" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div>

    <p><strong>Key language:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Category</strong> &ndash; one &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of the data (e.g. transport, energy, food).</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency</strong> &ndash; how many times that category appears (or how many responses).</li>
        <li><strong>Fraction of total</strong> &ndash; frequency &divide; total.</li>
        <li><strong>Percentage</strong> &ndash; fraction &times; 100.</li>
        <li><strong>Angle</strong> &ndash; fraction &times; 360&deg;, the size of the slice in the pie chart.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Using Activity 1:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose an SDG context (e.g. household waste types, energy sources, food groups in a lunch).</li>
        <li>Look at the table of categories and frequencies.</li>
        <li>Check how the app calculates:
            <ul>
                <li>Fractions and percentages for each category.</li>
                <li>Angles for each slice (angle = fraction &times; 360&deg;).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Observe how the pie chart changes when you edit the frequencies.</li>
        <li>Try the &ldquo;My SDG Scenario&rdquo; option and build a pie chart for your own SDG-related data (e.g. &ldquo;How my family uses water in a day&rdquo;).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> In your own words, explain why each slice of the pie chart is like a &ldquo;share of 360&deg;&rdquo; and a &ldquo;share of 100%&rdquo;.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Activity 2 &ndash; Read the Circle (SDG Pie Chart Explorer)</h3>
    <p>Now practise <strong>reading and interpreting</strong> pie charts about the SDGs.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 100.0000%; padding-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_gkwydIc/ouISkcnY5TW4bFrHIrVQMw/view?embed" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div>

    <p><strong>Using Activity 2:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose an SDG scenario (e.g. emissions by sector, time spent on subjects, after-school activities).</li>
        <li>Look at the pie chart and legend:
            <ul>
                <li>Which slice is largest? Which is smallest?</li>
                <li>Which slices together make about half of the circle?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Answer the questions in the app by estimating percentages and comparing slices.</li>
        <li>Use the &ldquo;Build My Own Pie Story&rdquo; mode to create your own SDG-based pie chart and one-sentence story.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> For one chart, describe which category you think should increase or decrease if we want to move closer to the SDG goals, and why.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌍 The Human Story</summary>
    <p>Pie charts are about <strong>shares</strong>: who or what gets which portion of something limited &ndash; time, money, energy, land, attention.</p>
    <p>In SDG contexts, a pie chart might show:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How a government splits its budget between health, education, transport and defence (SDG 3, 4, 10).</li>
        <li>How people in a city travel: walking, cycling, public transport, car (SDG 11).</li>
        <li>How electricity is generated: fossil fuels vs renewables (SDG 7 &amp; 13).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If one slice is huge (e.g. fossil fuels) and others (e.g. renewables) are tiny, that tells a story about what is being prioritised &ndash; and who might be harmed or helped.</p>
    <h3>Activity 3 &ndash; Comparing Pie Charts (SDG Fair Share)</h3>
    <p>Use this app to compare two pie charts side-by-side in SDG scenarios, and think about fairness and change.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 100.0000%; padding-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_gkEzbC8/mV7h2l-awrtedYdw9taWWw/view?embed" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div>

    <p><strong>Using Activity 3:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select an SDG scenario (e.g. budget in Region A vs Region B, transport modes in City 1 vs City 2, energy mix in Country X vs Y).</li>
        <li>Compare the two pies:
            <ul>
                <li>Which category&rsquo;s share increased from Pie A to Pie B?</li>
                <li>Which category&rsquo;s share decreased?</li>
                <li>Do any categories stay about the same?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Think about what these changes mean in real life:
            <ul>
                <li>More spending on education? Less on fossil fuels?</li>
                <li>More walking and cycling? Less car use?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Try the &ldquo;My Fair Share Story&rdquo; mode to create your own comparison (e.g. &ldquo;How our school spends its budget now vs how we&rsquo;d like it to be&rdquo;).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>✊ <strong>Justice Prompt:</strong> Look at one pair of pies and ask: <em>&ldquo;Who benefits from this distribution? Who might be missing out?&rdquo;</em> If you could change one slice, which would it be, and why?</p>

<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🗣 The Expressive Self</summary>
    <p>🎨 A pie chart is like a cake being shared. Some slices are big, some are tiny, and together they make a whole.</p>
    <p>Choose one SDG context you&rsquo;ve explored (or make your own) and do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Draw a simple pie chart sketch and annotate each slice with feelings as well as numbers, for example: <em>&ldquo;Car use &ndash; 40% &ndash; noisy &amp; polluting&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Walking &ndash; 15% &ndash; calm &amp; healthy&rdquo;</em>.</li>
        <li>Write a short paragraph starting with: <em>&ldquo;If this pie chart was a story about our world, it would say that&hellip;&rdquo;</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> How does it feel to see something you care about (like nature, health, or education) as just one slice of a pie?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🏗 The Designed World</summary>
    <p>Planners and leaders can use pie charts to decide where to focus effort and resources. But we can also use pie charts to imagine better designs for the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Challenge:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose one SDG topic (e.g. how energy is generated, how a school day is spent, how a city travels).</li>
        <li>Using Activity 1 or 3, create:
            <ul>
                <li>A &ldquo;current&rdquo; pie chart showing how things are now.</li>
                <li>An &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; pie chart showing how you think things should be to support people and the planet.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Write or record 3&ndash;4 bullet points explaining:
            <ul>
                <li>Which slices grew or shrank in your ideal pie.</li>
                <li>How these changes could help move towards the SDGs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>♿ <strong>Ethical Design Prompt:</strong> When you re-design a pie chart (e.g. budget, time, energy), how can you make sure that changes really support the groups who had the smallest or most vulnerable slices before?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌀 The Living Body</summary>
    <p>📍 Sometimes pie charts are about very human things: time, money, food, energy. Seeing small slices for important needs can feel heavy.</p>
    <p>Notice how your body feels when you see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A huge slice for something harmful (e.g. pollution, junk food, car journeys).</li>
        <li>A tiny slice for something caring (e.g. green space, rest, exercise, community time).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🫁 Try a simple grounding exercise:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Imagine a circle that represents <em>your</em> energy for today.</li>
        <li>Close your eyes (if safe) and breathe in for 4 counts, imagining that circle gently expanding.</li>
        <li>Breathe out for 6 counts, imagining the circle smoothing, not breaking into stressful slices.</li>
        <li>When you open your eyes, choose one small action that protects your own &ldquo;rest &amp; joy&rdquo; slice today.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> If you drew a pie chart of your own day (sleep, school, screens, movement, connection, rest), what tiny change would help your chart feel kinder to your body and mind?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🛠 Final Task: Sharing the Circle &ndash; An SDG Pie Chart Story</summary>
    <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Create and interpret a pie chart (or pair of pie charts) in an SDG context, and explain what they show about fairness and priorities.</p>
    <p>Choose one pathway:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pathway A &ndash; One Pie Chart</strong>
            <ul>

                </li>
                <li>Write a paragraph (6&ndash;8 sentences) explaining:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Which category has the largest share and what that means in context.</li>
                        <li>Which category has the smallest share.</li>
                        <li>One change you would like to see and why.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Use Activity 3 (Comparing Pie Charts) to choose an SDG scenario (or build &ldquo;My Fair Share Story&rdquo;).</li>
                <li>Record the percentages for each category in Pie A and Pie B.</li>
                <li>Write a comparison paragraph explaining:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Which slices grew and which shrank between the two charts.</li>
                        <li>Whether you think the change moves closer to or further from the SDG goals.</li>
                        <li>Who might feel the impact of this change in real life.</li>
                    </ul>
