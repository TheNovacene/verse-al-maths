    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🧠 The Knowing World</summary>
    <p><strong>Focus Concept (KS4 Statistics):</strong> Using cumulative frequency to describe how data builds up and to estimate medians and quartiles from real-world (SDG) contexts.</p>
    <p><strong>Seeds of Change (KS4):</strong> Construct and interpret cumulative frequency tables and graphs; use them to estimate and interpret medians and quartiles.</p>
    <h3>Activity 1 &ndash; Cumulative Frequency Table Builder (SDG Data)</h3>
    <p>Start by exploring how cumulative frequency tables are built from frequency tables, using SDG-themed data sets.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 100.0000%; padding-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_Cw4F2PY/tSSOM6iJAfCeCa0jWxqzGg/view?embed" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div>

    <p><strong>Key language:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequency</strong> &ndash; how many times a value (or class) occurs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cumulative frequency</strong> &ndash; a running total of frequencies up to and including that value or class.</li>
        <li><strong>Total frequency (N)</strong> &ndash; the sum of all frequencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Median position</strong> &ndash; at cumulative frequency <em>N/2</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Quartile positions</strong> &ndash; at <em>N/4</em> (Q1) and <em>3N/4</em> (Q3).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Using Activity 1:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select an SDG context, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>SDG 3 &ndash; hours of sleep for a group of teenagers.</li>
                <li>SDG 6 &ndash; litres of water used per person per day.</li>
                <li>SDG 7 &ndash; daily household electricity use.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Observe the <strong>frequency table</strong> and then the <strong>cumulative frequency column</strong>.</li>
        <li>Step through the cumulative frequencies if the app allows: how does each new row build on the ones before?</li>
        <li>Identify the total frequency <strong>N</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> In your own words, describe what cumulative frequency means in one of the SDG contexts. For example: &ldquo;By the time we reach 60 minutes of exercise, the cumulative frequency tells us how many teenagers do <em>up to</em> 60 minutes of exercise.&rdquo;</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Activity 2 &ndash; Cumulative Frequency Graph Explorer (SDG Contexts)</h3>
    <p>Next, explore how cumulative frequency graphs (ogives) are drawn from grouped data and how we can use them to estimate medians and quartiles.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 100.0000%; padding-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_DMG94f0/tqBkcZQgZVpXEI0X2YoUuA/view?embed" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div>
    <p><a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_DMG94f0/tqBkcZQgZVpXEI0X2YoUuA/view?utm_content=DAG_DMG94f0&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=embeds&amp;utm_source=link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Copy of Cumulative Frequency Graph Explorer Web App for GCSE Maths (SDG Context) </a> by Gerry Docherty</p>
    <p><strong>Using Activity 2:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose a scenario (e.g. study time per week, physical activity minutes, or commute times).</li>
        <li>Look at the grouped data and its cumulative frequency table.</li>
        <li>Watch how the app plots points (upper class boundary, cumulative frequency) and joins them to make the cumulative frequency curve.</li>
        <li>Use the tools in the app to find:
            <ul>
                <li>The median (at cumulative frequency <em>N/2</em>).</li>
                <li>The lower quartile Q1 (at <em>N/4</em>).</li>
                <li>The upper quartile Q3 (at <em>3N/4</em>).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> Choose one context (e.g. commute time). What does the median tell you about students&rsquo; experience? What does the interquartile range (IQR = Q3 &minus; Q1) tell you about how varied their experiences are?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌍 The Human Story</summary>
    <p>Cumulative frequency turns lists of numbers into a picture of <strong>how many people are at or below each value</strong>.</p>
    <p>In SDG contexts, that might mean:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How many people get <em>at most</em> 6 hours of sleep per night (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being).</li>
        <li>How many households use <em>at most</em> a certain amount of water per day (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation).</li>
        <li>How many students travel less than 20 minutes to school (SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When we look at the curve, we&rsquo;re really asking: <strong>&ldquo;By this point, how many people are included?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p>⚖️ Cumulative frequency graphs can highlight inequality: for example, if one group&rsquo;s curve grows quickly at low values (short commute times) and another group&rsquo;s curve lags behind, that tells a story about access, opportunity, or strain.</p>
    <p>✊ <strong>Justice Prompt:</strong> Choose one SDG context in the apps. Who might be most affected by being in the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the distribution (e.g. the longest commute, the lowest sleep, the highest water use)? How might this impact their health, learning or wellbeing?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🗣 The Expressive Self</summary>
    <p>🎨 Imagine the cumulative frequency curve as a journey:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At the start, almost nobody is included.</li>
        <li>As we move along the x-axis (time, hours, usage), more and more people join the total.</li>
        <li>Eventually, everyone is included at the top of the curve (total frequency N).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Choose one SDG scenario (sleep, water use, commute time) and do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Draw a sketch of the cumulative frequency curve and label where the median and quartiles are. Add speech bubbles like: <em>&ldquo;Half of us are here by this point&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Most of us are included by here.&rdquo;</em></li>
        <li>Write a short paragraph or poem that personifies the curve (e.g. &ldquo;I climb steadily as more teenagers get enough sleep&hellip;&rdquo;).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> If you think of yourself as a point on the curve in one context (e.g. sleep time), where would you like to be, and why?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🏗 The Designed World</summary>
    <p>Now we&rsquo;ll use cumulative frequency graphs to <strong>compare two groups</strong> in SDG-related scenarios and make evidence-based statements.</p>
    <h3>Activity 3 &ndash; Comparing Cumulative Frequency Graphs (SDG Stories)</h3>
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 100.0000%; padding-bottom: 0; margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_DNaIojg/hTDNH3DV8SgEMVmKR0CEUQ/view?embed" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div>

    <p><strong>Using Activity 3:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select an SDG scenario (e.g. two different communities&rsquo; water use, two groups&rsquo; commute times, or two classes&rsquo; study hours).</li>
        <li>Study the two cumulative frequency curves on the same axes (Group A vs Group B).</li>
        <li>Use the tool to estimate:
            <ul>
                <li>The median for each group.</li>
                <li>The quartiles for each group (Q1, Q3).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Compare the groups:
            <ul>
                <li>Which group has the higher median?</li>
                <li>Which group has the larger IQR (more variation in the middle 50%)?</li>
                <li>For lower values (e.g. shorter commutes, more sleep), which group has a higher cumulative frequency earlier?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>👥 <strong>Buddy Challenge:</strong> With a partner, pick one SDG scenario and write a joint statement using the graph: <em>&ldquo;In this context, Group A generally experiences &hellip; while Group B tends to &hellip; . We know this because the median and quartiles show &hellip; .&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>♿ <strong>Ethical Design Prompt:</strong> If these graphs were being shown to decision-makers (school leaders, local government, health organisations), what extra context would you want them to see so they don&rsquo;t oversimplify or blame a group based only on one graph?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌀 The Living Body</summary>
    <p>📍 Looking at data about sleep, water use, or commute times can feel personal or unfair. You might think: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck in the high end of this graph.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Notice how your body responds when you see yourself (or your community) in the &ldquo;upper tail&rdquo; or at the &ldquo;lower end&rdquo; of a distribution.</p>
    <p>🫁 Try this grounding sequence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look away from the screen and name 3 things you can see in the room.</li>
        <li>Take a slow breath in for 4 counts, and out for 6 counts.</li>
        <li>Gently stretch your shoulders and hands, then return to the graph.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>💬 <strong>Prompt:</strong> How can you use data about your life (sleep, movement, travel) to support your wellbeing, rather than judge yourself?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🛠 Final Task: Who Is Most Affected?</summary>
    <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Use cumulative frequency to answer a real question about one SDG context, and explain your reasoning clearly.</p>
    <p>Choose one option:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Option A &ndash; One Group, Deep Dive</strong>
            <ul>

                </li>
                <li>In a short paragraph (6&ndash;8 sentences), answer: <em>&ldquo;What does the median tell us about this group? What does the IQR tell us about how similar or different people&rsquo;s experiences are?&rdquo;</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Option B &ndash; Two Groups Compared (SDG Story)</strong>

                        <li>Which group generally has the &ldquo;better&rdquo; outcome in the SDG context (e.g. shorter commutes, more sleep, safer water use)?</li>
                        <li>Which group shows more variation in experience, and what that might mean in real life.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
