    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🧠 The Knowing World</summary>
    <p><strong>Focus Concept:</strong> Theoretical vs Experimental Probability</p>
    <p>The <strong>theoretical probability</strong> of an event is what we expect to happen in a perfectly fair system. For example, the chance of rolling a 7 as the sum of two dice is 6 out of 36, or 1/6.</p>
    <p>The <strong>experimental probability</strong> is what we actually observe when we do an experiment &mdash; like our horse race!</p>
    <p>🎯 Use the grid in the app to complete the <strong>probability space diagram</strong>. Add together the two dice in each cell. How many ways are there to make each total?</p>
    <p>💡 What patterns do you notice in the sums? Why is 7 the most common?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌍 The Human Story</summary>
    <p>Probability is used everywhere &mdash; from predicting the weather to designing fair games and testing medical treatments. But what happens when our expectations don&rsquo;t match reality?</p>
    <p>✊ Injustice can occur when probability is misunderstood &mdash; such as unfair algorithms or biased assumptions in policing and education.</p>
    <p>🧵 Whose lives are affected when real-world outcomes don&rsquo;t reflect theoretical models? How can we design systems that are fair, transparent, and evidence-based?</p>

<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🗣 The Expressive Self</summary>
    <p>🎨 Imagine each horse in this game has a personality. What kind of "person" is Horse 7? What about Horse 2?</p>
    <p>✏ Draw a comic or write a story about the race. How do the horses feel about their chances?</p>
    <p>🧠 In your own words, explain why some outcomes are more likely than others, even when everything is "fair."</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🏗 The Designed World</summary>
    <p>🎲 Use the interactive tool above to run the horse race. Roll the dice and watch the horses move based on the sum of the dice.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before starting, make a prediction: Which horse will win?</li>
        <li>As you play, record how many times each total appears.</li>
        <li>Compare the experimental results to the theoretical probabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>📊 What do you notice over time? Does the actual data match what you expected?</p>
    <p>👥 <strong>Buddy Challenge:</strong> Compare predictions and outcomes with a classmate. Whose prediction came closest to the final result? Why?</p>
    <p>♿ <strong>Design Prompt:</strong> How would you redesign the game for someone who can&rsquo;t use a mouse or who uses a screen reader?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌀 The Living Body</summary>
    <p>🧘 How do you feel when your prediction is wrong? What happens in your body when you're surprised by the result?</p>
    <p>🫁 Try this: breathe in for &ldquo;Expect&rdquo;, breathe out for &ldquo;Observe&rdquo;. Let go of outcomes and focus on noticing patterns.</p>
    <p>🎯 Tap your fingers slowly from 2 to 12. Which numbers feel more &ldquo;stable&rdquo;? Which feel like long shots?</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🛠 Final Task: The Race Report</summary>
    <p><strong>Submit the following:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>🧮 A completed probability space diagram showing all 36 dice combinations.</li>
        <li>📊 A table showing the number of times each total appeared during your race.</li>
        <li>📝 A short explanation of how the experimental results compared to the theoretical probabilities.</li>
        <li>💡 A design idea to make the game more inclusive or informative.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎓 This task is assessed using the GCSE Maths Rubric:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conceptual Understanding:</strong> Did you understand and explain the difference between theoretical and experimental probability?</li>
        <li><strong>Fluency &amp; Accuracy:</strong> Did you complete the diagram and track the data correctly?</li>
        <li><strong>Application to Problems:</strong> Did you analyse outcomes and interpret patterns?</li>
        <li><strong>Independence &amp; Reflection:</strong> Did you reflect on the unpredictability of outcomes and suggest improvements?</li>
    </ul>
