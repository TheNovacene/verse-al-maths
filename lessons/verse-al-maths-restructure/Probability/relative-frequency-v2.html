    <p><strong>Focus Concept:</strong> Relative Frequency in Probability</p>
    <p>Probability is the chance of something happening. <em>Relative frequency</em> is how often an outcome happens compared to the total number of trials, and it gets closer to the true probability the more we repeat the experiment.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong><br /><code>Relative Frequency = Number of Times Outcome Occurs &divide; Total Number of Trials</code></p>
    <p>💡 What do you notice as the number of dice rolls increases? How does the relative frequency compare with the theoretical probability (1/6)?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌍 The Human Story</summary>
    <p>Probability and risk aren't just maths &mdash; they're tools used to make decisions in healthcare, climate science, insurance, and justice.</p>
    <p>But they&rsquo;ve also been used unfairly &mdash; like biased policing tools that rely on flawed data.</p>
    <p>✊ <strong>Justice Prompt:</strong> How can experimental probability help us challenge assumptions or make decisions based on evidence?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🗣 The Expressive Self</summary>
    <p>🎨 Create a metaphor or sketch: Is probability like balancing scales? A spinning wheel? A wave in the ocean?</p>
    <p>✏ In your own words, explain how you feel when the dice roll doesn&rsquo;t go the way you expected. What do you think is &ldquo;fair&rdquo;?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🏗 The Designed World</summary>
    <p>Use the interactive dice app above. Roll the die repeatedly and record the outcomes for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>10 rolls</li>
        <li>20 rolls</li>
        <li>30 rolls</li>
        <li>...up to 100 rolls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Observe how the relative frequency changes. Does it begin to look like 1/6 for each number?</p>
    <p>👥 <strong>Buddy Challenge:</strong> Compare your results with a partner. Did you both get similar relative frequencies? Why or why not?</p>
    <p>♿ <strong>Ethical Design Prompt:</strong> How would you redesign this tool to support someone who cannot use a mouse or who sees colours differently?</p>

    <p>📍 Pause: How do you feel when outcomes are uncertain?</p>
    <p>🙌 Movement: Trace the pattern of the die roll with your finger. Tap your hand six times &mdash; once for each face. Notice the rhythm.</p>
    <p>🫁 Breathe in for &ldquo;Try&rdquo;, out for &ldquo;Observe&rdquo; &mdash; repeat for six rolls. How does breathing help you focus on patterns instead of outcomes?</p>

    <p><strong>Submit:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your completed frequency and relative frequency table (from the interactive tool).</li>
        <li>A short reflection: &ldquo;What did I notice as the number of rolls increased?&rdquo;</li>
        <li>One idea to improve or redesign the dice experiment for accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎓 Assessed Using:</strong> GCSE Maths Rubric</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conceptual Understanding</strong> &ndash; Can you explain why relative frequency changes?</li>
        <li><strong>Fluency &amp; Accuracy</strong> &ndash; Did you correctly calculate and update your frequencies?</li>
        <li><strong>Application to Problems</strong> &ndash; Did you use the data to draw meaningful conclusions?</li>
