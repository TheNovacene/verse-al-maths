    <p><strong>Focus Concept:</strong> The Addition Rule for Probability</p>
    <p>The probability of either event A or event B happening is given by the addition rule:</p>
    <p><code>P(A &cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &cap; B)</code></p>
    <p>Here, the universal set is a full deck of 52 playing cards.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set A = All Kings</li>
        <li>Set B = All Black Cards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>🎯 Your task is to use the interactive Venn diagram to sort all cards correctly, then use your diagram to calculate probabilities based on what you&rsquo;ve placed.</p>
    <p>💬 What happens if you forget to subtract the overlap? What does the intersection represent in this context?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌍 The Human Story</summary>
    <p>Probability helps us interpret uncertain situations &mdash; but only if we understand how events might overlap.</p>
    <p>For example, in public health data, one person may belong to more than one group (e.g., "under 18" and "at risk").</p>
    <p>✊ Misinterpreting overlaps can lead to double-counting, flawed policies, or unfair decisions.</p>
    <p>🧵 Where in your life might groups overlap? Why is it important to notice the intersection?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🗣 The Expressive Self</summary>
    <p>🎨 Create a visual story of a card&rsquo;s journey. Imagine you are the King of Spades. What does it feel like to belong to both sets? What is it like to be outside both?</p>
    <p>✏ Sketch your own Venn diagram using two groups from your life &mdash; for example, "likes music" and "plays a sport." Who&rsquo;s in the overlap?</p>
    <p>💬 In your own words: What does this lesson teach you about fairness, visibility, or belonging?</p>

    <p>Use the interactive game above:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click &ldquo;Deal Card&rdquo; to reveal a card from the 52-card deck.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop the card into the correct region of the Venn diagram:
            <ul>
                <li>A only = King but not black</li>
                <li>B only = Black but not King</li>
                <li>A &cap; B = Black Kings</li>
                <li>Outside = Neither King nor black</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After all cards are placed, answer the probability questions:
            <ul>
                <li>P(King)</li>
                <li>P(Black)</li>
                <li>P(Black &cap; King)</li>
                <li>P(Black &cup; King)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click &ldquo;Check Answers&rdquo; to see feedback.</li>
        <li>Use the &ldquo;Try Another&rdquo; button to explore new combinations (e.g., Queens and Red Cards).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>📍 Sorting tasks can be calming or stressful &mdash; how does your body feel as the diagram fills?</p>
    <p>🫁 Try this breath pattern: Inhale for &ldquo;Place&rdquo;, exhale for &ldquo;Predict.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>💡 When you feel confused about sets or overlaps, where do you feel it? What helps you get unstuck?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🛠 Final Task: Probability from Venn Diagrams</summary>
    <p><strong>Submit the following:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>📸 A screenshot of your completed Venn diagram.</li>
        <li>🧠 Your answers to the four probability questions.</li>
        <li>🔍 A short reflection: Which part of the Venn was hardest to fill? Why?</li>
        <li>♻ One idea to change the sets and test a new rule.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎓 Assessed using the GCSE Maths Rubric:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conceptual Understanding:</strong> Did you apply the addition rule correctly?</li>
        <li><strong>Fluency &amp; Accuracy:</strong> Were the cards sorted correctly into all four zones?</li>
        <li><strong>Application to Problems:</strong> Did you calculate accurate probabilities based on your diagram?</li>
        <li><strong>Independence &amp; Reflection:</strong> Did you reflect thoughtfully and suggest improvements?</li>
