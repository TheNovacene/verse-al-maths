    <p><strong>Focus Concept:</strong> Using Tree Diagrams to Represent Independent and Conditional Probability</p>
    <p>Tree diagrams help us map all possible outcomes of multi-stage events and calculate the probabilities of combinations.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Ideas:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent events:</strong> The outcome of one stage does not affect the next (e.g., flipping two coins).</li>
        <li><strong>Conditional events:</strong> The outcome of one stage influences the probabilities in the next stage (e.g., drawing counters without replacement).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use this interactive tool to build your own tree diagrams and explore how probabilities multiply along each branch.</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌍 The Human Story</summary>
    <p>We use probability trees to plan for uncertainty &mdash; from medical testing to climate forecasting, from risk analysis to AI modelling.</p>
    <p>⚖️ But we must be careful &mdash; assumptions of independence in real-life scenarios can lead to mistakes or biased decisions.</p>
    <p>🧵 Think about a time when one event clearly affected what came next. Was the outcome what you expected? How might a tree diagram have helped you anticipate that?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🗣 The Expressive Self</summary>
    <p>🎨 Try drawing a tree diagram for something in your own life &mdash; for example, getting ready in the morning (e.g., &ldquo;on time&rdquo; vs &ldquo;late&rdquo;, then &ldquo;bus early&rdquo; vs &ldquo;bus delayed&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>🧠 How does it feel when outcomes depend on each other? What part of your daily routine feels like it has independent steps?</p>
    <p>✏ In your own words: What is the difference between multiplying and adding probabilities? When do you do each?</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🏗 The Designed World</summary>
    <p>Use the interactive app above:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a context: Counters or Custom Event.</li>
        <li>Choose &ldquo;with replacement&rdquo; or &ldquo;without replacement&rdquo; to explore independence vs conditionality.</li>
        <li>Build your tree diagram using the visual editor.</li>
        <li>Click on different branches to see total outcome probabilities.</li>
        <li>Try calculating:
            <ul>
                <li>The probability of a specific outcome (e.g., &ldquo;Red then Green&rdquo;).</li>
                <li>The total probability of all paths ending with a specific result.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>🛠 Can you change the scenario to model a real-world system like drawing names, picking teams, or choosing meals?</p>
    <p>👥 <strong>Buddy Challenge:</strong> Work with a partner to build two different tree diagrams: one independent, one conditional. Compare how the probabilities change.</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🌀 The Living Body</summary>
    <p>📍 Tree diagrams can feel overwhelming at first. Notice if you feel tense or confused. Where in your body does that happen?</p>
    <p>🫁 Take a pause: Inhale for &ldquo;Step one&rdquo;, exhale for &ldquo;Step two.&rdquo; Break the process down into parts.</p>
    <p>💡 Stretch your arms like branches of a tree. Imagine possibilities expanding and reconnecting.</p>

    <summary style="font-size: 1.25em;">🛠 Final Task: Build and Analyse a Probability Tree</summary>
    <p><strong>Submit the following:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>📸 A screenshot of your completed tree diagram from the interactive app.</li>
        <li>🧮 A worked-out solution for at least two probability questions based on your tree.</li>
        <li>📝 A short explanation: &ldquo;How do we know if the events are independent or conditional?&rdquo;</li>
        <li>💡 A suggestion for a real-world situation you could model with a tree diagram.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎓 Assessed using the GCSE Maths Rubric:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conceptual Understanding:</strong> Did you clearly identify and model each stage?</li>
        <li><strong>Fluency &amp; Accuracy:</strong> Are the calculations for each branch correct?</li>
        <li><strong>Application to Problems:</strong> Can you interpret the outcome probabilities?</li>
        <li><strong>Independence &amp; Reflection:</strong> Did you reflect thoughtfully and adapt the diagram to different scenarios?</li>
    </ul>
