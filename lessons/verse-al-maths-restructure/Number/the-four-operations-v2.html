        <h3>Seeds of Change (Key Stage 3 &ndash; Number)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) with integers and decimals.</li>
            <li>Choose efficient methods (mental strategies, written methods, calculator when appropriate).</li>
            <li>Use inverse operations and estimation to check answers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Ideas &amp; Vocabulary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operation</strong>: a process you do to a number (add, subtract, multiply, divide).</li>
            <li><strong>Inverse</strong>: an operation that &ldquo;undoes&rdquo; another (addition &harr; subtraction, multiplication &harr; division).</li>
            <li><strong>Estimate</strong>: a close, sensible guess you can do in your head to check if an answer is reasonable.</li>
            <li><strong>Integer</strong>: whole number (negative, zero, positive).</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal</strong>: number that includes tenths, hundredths, etc. (e.g. 3.7, 0.45).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Quick Warm-Up (Choose 3&ndash;5)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mental addition: 47 + 38 &nbsp;&nbsp; (How did you do it in your head?)</li>
            <li>Mental subtraction: 102 &minus; 67</li>
            <li>Mental multiplication: 6 &times; 24</li>
            <li>Division with remainder: 95 &divide; 4</li>
            <li>Decimals: 3.5 + 1.9, &nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2 &times; 3</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Operations as &ldquo;Moves&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>Imagine a number line:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Addition</strong> = move <em>right</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Subtraction</strong> = move <em>left</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiplication</strong> = repeated addition (e.g. 4 &times; 3 = 4 + 4 + 4).</li>
            <li><strong>Division</strong> = sharing or grouping (e.g. 12 &divide; 3 = &ldquo;12 shared into 3 equal groups&rdquo;).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Partner Check: Inverse Operations</h3>
        <p>Work in pairs or small groups. For each calculation, write its &ldquo;inverse check&rdquo;.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>37 + 25 = 62 &nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp; inverse: ?</li>
            <li>120 &minus; 47 = 73 &nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp; inverse: ?</li>
            <li>9 &times; 7 = 63 &nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp; inverse: ?</li>
            <li>56 &divide; 8 = 7 &nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp; inverse: ?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Low-Floor, High-Ceiling Practice</h3>
        <p>Start where you feel comfortable, then move up when you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1 &ndash; Steady Steps</strong>: Whole numbers under 100.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2 &ndash; Stretch</strong>: Include decimals and bigger numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3 &ndash; Challenge</strong>: Mix operations and include negative numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Create 2 questions at your chosen level for each operation, then solve them and check using inverses or estimation.</p>

        <h3>Where Do We See the 4 Operations in Real Life?</h3>
        <p>Imagine a teenager planning their week:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They <strong>add</strong> up pocket money and part-time job earnings.</li>
            <li>They <strong>subtract</strong> bus fares and snacks to see what is left.</li>
            <li>They <strong>multiply</strong> to work out pay for several hours of work.</li>
            <li>They <strong>divide</strong> costs fairly when sharing food or data with friends.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fairness &amp; Justice</h3>
        <p>Operations can help us check if things are fair:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is everyone getting a fair share of group money?</li>
            <li>Are &ldquo;special offers&rdquo; honest or a trick?</li>
            <li>Is someone being underpaid for the work they do?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Discussion Prompts</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Think of a time when you needed to add, subtract, multiply or divide in real life (shopping, games, cooking, travel). What happened?</li>
            <li>Have you ever felt <em>cheated</em> because the maths wasn&rsquo;t done fairly or correctly?</li>
            <li>Which operation do you trust yourself with most? Which one feels harder or less familiar?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Mini Task &ndash; Story of a Number</h3>
        <p>Write a short story (or comic strip plan) about a character who needs the four operations to solve a problem, e.g. planning a trip, running a small business, or sharing money fairly in a group.</p>
        <p>Underline or highlight where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division appear in the story.</p>

        <h3>Operations with Personality</h3>
        <p>Choose one of these ways (or invent your own) to show what the four operations are like in your mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A &ndash; Character Design</strong>: Turn +, &minus;, &times;, &divide; into four characters.
                <ul>
                    <li>What are their personalities?</li>
                    <li>How do they help each other?</li>
                    <li>Which ones are &ldquo;opposites&rdquo; (inverses)?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Option B &ndash; Metaphor or Poem</strong>: Describe each operation using a metaphor.
                <ul>
                    <li>Addition is like&hellip;</li>
                    <li>Subtraction is like&hellip;</li>
                    <li>Multiplication is like&hellip;</li>
                    <li>Division is like&hellip;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Option C &ndash; Visual Map</strong>: Create a mind map or sketch showing how the four operations connect and undo each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Explain Your Thinking</h3>
        <p>Under your drawing/poem/map, write 3&ndash;4 sentences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which operation feels most &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; to you and why?</li>
            <li>Which operation feels &ldquo;spiky&rdquo; or difficult? What usually makes it hard?</li>
            <li>How could seeing operations as characters or metaphors make problems easier to remember or understand?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design a &ldquo;Fair Deal Checker&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>In this part of the lesson, you&rsquo;ll use the four operations to design something <em>useful</em> for real-life decisions.</p>
        <h4>Step 1 &ndash; Choose a Context</h4>
        <p>Pick one (or invent your own):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shopping</strong>: Comparing prices, &ldquo;3 for 2&rdquo; offers, discounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Food</strong>: Sharing a pizza or recipe between friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Time</strong>: Planning a study timetable or gaming time fairly in a week.</li>
            <li><strong>Money</strong>: Splitting bills, saving over several weeks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 2 &ndash; Build Example Problems</h4>
        <p>Create at least 3 problems in your context. Each problem must require <em>at least two</em> different operations.</p>
        <p>Example (shopping):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy drinks cost &pound;1.20 each. You buy 3. You pay with a &pound;5 note. How much change should you get?</li>
            <li>Which operations did you use? How did you check your answer?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 3 &ndash; Use the Interactive Tool</h4>
        <p>Use the Canva &ldquo;Deal or No Deal?&rdquo; app above to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare at least two of your own deals.</li>
            <li>Check your answers from one of your written problems.</li>
            <li>Notice where you are adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 4 &ndash; Checkers and Shortcuts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For each problem, write an <strong>inverse calculation</strong> or <strong>estimate</strong> to check your answer.</li>
            <li>Describe any <strong>shortcuts</strong> you used (e.g. &ldquo;I multiplied by 10 then halved it&rdquo; for &times;5).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Noticing How Maths Feels</h3>
        <p>Pause for a moment and notice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How does your body feel when you see a long calculation?</li>
            <li>Do your shoulders, breath or jaw change when you feel &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;?</li>
            <li>Which operation makes you feel tense or worried?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Small Regulation Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Box Breathing</strong>: Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4 (repeat 3 times).</li>
            <li><strong>Shake &amp; Reset</strong>: Gently shake out your hands, roll your shoulders, then come back.</li>
            <li><strong>Micro-break</strong>: Look away from the page/screen and find 5 objects of a certain colour in the room.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Learning About Your Learning</h3>
        <p>Complete these sentence starters in your book or on a sticky note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;One thing that <strong>helps</strong> me with operations is&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;I find it <strong>hard</strong> when calculations&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Next time I get stuck on a calculation, I will try&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you feel safe to, share one of your ideas with a partner or the teacher.</p>
