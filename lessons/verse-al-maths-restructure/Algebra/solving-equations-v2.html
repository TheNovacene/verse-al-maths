        <p><em>"To understand the laws that guide, the patterns hidden deep inside."</em></p>
        <p>In algebra, an equation is like a balance scale &mdash; both sides must weigh the same. To solve an equation, we use operations to isolate the variable (usually <strong>x</strong>) while keeping the equation balanced.</p>
        <h4>📘 Glossary:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equation:</strong> A statement showing two expressions are equal</li>
            <li><strong>Variable:</strong> A letter (like x or y) that stands for a number</li>
            <li><strong>Inverse Operation:</strong> The opposite mathematical operation (e.g. subtraction is inverse of addition)</li>
            <li><strong>Isolate the Variable:</strong> Get the letter by itself on one side of the equation</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>🔍 Patterns to Know:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by undoing addition or subtraction</li>
            <li>Then undo multiplication or division</li>
            <li>Always do the same thing to both sides</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>"To trace the paths of lives before, and ask what justice calls us for."</em></p>
        <p>Equations are a powerful language &mdash; they help us model change, compare quantities, and find balance. In education, they can even model fairness: making sure everyone has what they need to succeed.</p>
        <p><strong>Justice Prompt (SDG 4 &ndash; Quality Education):</strong> How is solving equations like creating fairness in a classroom or society?</p>

        <summary><strong>🗣 3. The Expressive Self</strong></summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Write or draw how a balanced scale helps you "feel" what&rsquo;s happening in an equation</li>
            <li>Create a visual metaphor: What else in life feels like solving an equation?</li>
            <li>Invent a character called &ldquo;X&rdquo; &mdash; describe what they need to get free!</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>"How do you relate to the idea of balance and solving for the unknown?"</blockquote>

        <h4>🧩 Try These Examples:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> x + 4 = 10 &rarr; Subtract 4</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> 3x = 12 &rarr; Divide by 3</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> 2x + 3 = 11 &rarr; Subtract 3, then divide</li>
            <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> 2x + 4 = x + 7 &rarr; Rearrange terms</li>
        </ul>
