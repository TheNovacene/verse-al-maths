# Verse-al Maths — inclusion-ready curriculum for cloud schools

Canvas-first GCSE/KS3 maths you can deploy tomorrow for learners who can’t attend on site. Hyflex, flipped, neurodivergent-affirming — so you can meet inclusion duties without building a whole online school.

- Multiple ways of knowing: **Knowing World · Human Story · Expressive Self · Designed World · Living Body**
- Canvas (.imscc) and standalone HTML packs (distributed via Gumroad)
- Assessment-kind: evidence of thinking > auto-grading hype
- Optional formative AI helper (no grading; teacher stays the judge)

## Quick start
- Using Canvas? See **docs/setup-canvas.md** (coming next).
- No Canvas? Use the HTML pack; see **docs/setup-html.md**.

## Modules (current)
- Number (v1)
- Algebra — Quadratics (v1)
- Geometry & Measures (v1, Early Access)

> Commercial packs with updates are sold via Gumroad. This repo hosts docs, templates, and setup guides.
